# Ancela

Ancela is an experimental AI assistant. The goal of this project is to create an assistant that is actually useful by integrating with real-world services, supplementing them with special AI abilities, and possessing limited autonomy. 

## How It Works

Ancela is built using modern cloud-native patterns: .NET Aspire for infrastructure-as-code, Azure Functions for serverless compute, Azure Cosmos DB for scalable storage, and Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration. The assistant interacts with users via SMS using Twilio, and leverages OpenAI GPT models to understand and respond to natural language requests.

Ancela's capabilities include:
- Managing todos
- Accessing calendar events
- Reading and sending emails
- Searching contacts
- Storing persistent knowledge
- Accessing personal finances

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tombly/ancela.git
   cd ancela
   ```
2. **Configure Graph Access**

- Navigate to your organization's Entra admin center [https://aad.portal.azure.com/] and login with a Global administrator account.

- Select a directory and then select App registrations under Manage.

- Select New registration. Enter a name for your application, for example, Ancela AI.

- Set Supported account types to Accounts in this organizational directory only.

- Leave Redirect URI empty.

- Select Register. On the application's Overview page, copy the value of the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID and save them, you will need these values in the next step.

- Select API permissions under Manage.

- Remove the default User.Read permission under Configured permissions by selecting the ellipses (...) in its row and selecting Remove permission.

- Perform the following steps for each of the permissions `User.Read.All`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `Contacts.Read`, `Mail.Read`, and `Mail.Send`:

  - Select Add a permission, then Microsoft Graph.

  - Select Application permissions.

  - Select User.Read.All, then select Add permissions.

- Select Grant admin consent for..., then select Yes to provide admin consent for the selected permission.

- Select Certificates and secrets under Manage, then select New client secret.

- Enter a description, choose a duration, and select Add.

- Copy the secret from the Value column, you will need it in the next step.

3. **Configure user secrets**
   
   Navigate to the AppHost project folder and set your secrets:
   ```bash
   cd Ancela.AppHost
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:openai-api-key "your-openai-api-key"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:twilio-account-sid "your-twilio-account-sid"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:twilio-auth-token "your-twilio-auth-token"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:twilio-phone-number "your-twilio-phone-number"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:graph-user-id "your-entra-user-id"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:graph-tenant-id "your-entra-tenant-id"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:graph-client-id "your-graph-app-client-id"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:graph-client-secret "your-graph-app-client-secret"
   dotnet user-secrets set Parameters:ynab-access-token "your-ynab-access-token"
   ```

4. **Update the resource group name**
   
   Edit `FixedNameInfrastructureResolver.cs` and`configure_cosmos.sh` to set your resource group name and cosmos resource name.

5. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Ancela.AppHost
   ```

   The Aspire dashboard will launch, showing all running services and their endpoints.

### Deployment to Azure

1. **Configure infrastructure**
   
   The project uses .NET Aspire for infrastructure-as-code. Bicep templates generated by Aspire are generated in `Ancela.AppHost/aspire-output/`.

2. **Deploy using Aspire**
   ```bash
   azd init
   azd up
   ```

   Aspire will prompt you for required secrets during deployment. You can easily grab them from the user secrets:
   ```bash
   cd Ancela.AppHost
   dotnet user-secrets list | grep Parameters
   ```

3. **Post-deployment configuration**

   After deploying, grant your Entra principal the Contributor role for Cosmos DB so you can access Data Explorer and create the Cosmos DB database and containers:
   ```bash
   ./configure_cosmos.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Starting a Session

Send an SMS to your Twilio number:
```
hello ancela
```

### Interacting

```
Remember that my favorite color is blue
Save a todo: buy milk, eggs, and bread
List my todos
What's on my calendar today?
